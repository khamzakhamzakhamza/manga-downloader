# Project rules

Don't put any comments anywhere, they are super annoying.

Don't try to catch any exceptions, unless instructed otherwise.

Don't print any outputs or logs, unless instructed otherwise.

Output the simplest code you can, don't try to be fancy.

Don't run any terminal commands.

Keep commit messages to one short sentence.

Can you gime me plans to approve before implementing anything complex pls.
